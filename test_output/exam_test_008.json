          "explanation": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\nA) The product of two irrational numbers is not always irrational. For example, √{2} is irrational, and √{2} is irrational, but their product √{2} × √{2} = 2, which is a rational number.\n\nB) The sum of a rational number and an irrational number is always irrational, not rational. For example, 3 (rational) + √{5} (irrational) = 3 + √{5}, which is irrational.\n\nC) This statement is true. If r is a non-zero rational number and s is an irrational number, assume their product rs is rational. Then s = (rs/r). Since r is a non-zero rational and rs is rational, (rs/r) would be rational, which implies s is rational. This contradicts our initial assumption that s is irrational. Therefore, the product of a non-zero rational number and an irrational number must be irrational.\n\nD) The sum of two rational numbers is always rational. For example, (1/2) (rational) + (1/3) (rational) = (5/6), which is rational. It can never be irrational.\n\nThus, option C is the correct statement.",

This is because ending in zero implies divisibility by 10, and 10 = 2 × 5.\n\nAssertion (A): The given number is 14ⁿ. The prime factorization of 14 is 2 × 7. Therefore, 14ⁿ = (2 × 7)^n = 2ⁿ × 7ⁿ.\nIn the prime factorization of 14ⁿ, the only prime factors are 2 and 7. There is no factor of 5.\nAccording to the condition stated above, since 5 is not a prime factor of 14ⁿ, it cannot end with the digit zero for any natural number n. So, Assertion (A) is true.\n\nReason (R): The statement 'A number ends with the digit zero if and only if its prime factorization contains both 2 and 5' is a fundamental concept derived from the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. This condition is necessary and sufficient for a number to have 0 at its unit's place. So, Reason (R) is true.\n\nSince Reason (R) provides the exact condition which is used to justify why 14ⁿ cannot end with the digit zero (due to the absence of the prime factor 5), Reason (R) is the correct explanation for Assertion (A).",

Since a and b are integers, 5b - a is an integer, and 2b is a non-zero integer. Therefore, the expression (5b - a/2b) is a rational number (as it is a ratio of two integers with a non-zero denominator).\n\nStep 5: From Step 3, we have √{3} = (5b - a/2b). This implies that √{3} is a rational number.\n\nStep 6: However, we are given that √{3} is an irrational number. This creates a contradiction with our deduction in Step 5.\n\nStep 7: This contradiction arises because our initial assumption that 5 - 2√{3} is rational must be false.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, 5 - 2√{3} must be an irrational number.",

          "explanation": "**(A) Proof that √{5} is an irrational number:**\nAssume, to the contrary, that √{5} is a rational number. \nThen, we can write √{5} = (p/q), where p and q are co-prime integers and q ≠ 0.\nSquaring both sides, we get 5 = (p²/q²), which implies p² = 5q². \nThis means p² is divisible by 5. By Theorem 1.3 (If a prime number p divides a², then p divides a), if 5 divides p², then 5 must divide p.\nSo, we can write p = 5k for some integer k.\nSubstitute p = 5k into the equation p² = 5q²:\n(5k)^2 = 5q²\n25k² = 5q²\n5k² = q²\nThis means q² is divisible by 5. Again, by Theorem 1.3, if 5 divides q², then 5 must divide q.\nSo, both p and q are divisible by 5. This contradicts our initial assumption that p and q are co-prime integers (i.e., they have no common factor other than 1).\nTherefore, our assumption that √{5} is rational is false. Hence, √{5} is an irrational number.\n\n**(B) Finding LCM of two positive integers:**\nGiven HCF = 18 and Product = 12960.\nFor two positive integers, we know that HCF × LCM = Product of the two numbers.\nSo, 18 × text{LCM} = 12960\ntext{LCM} = (12960/18)\ntext{LCM} = 720\n\n**(C) Evaluating the minimum possible sum of a+b+c:**\nGiven prime factorizations:\nP = 2ᵃ × 3³ × 5¹\nQ = 2⁴ × 3ᵇ × 7¹\nR = 2ᶜ × 3¹ × 5²\n\nGiven HCF(P, Q, R) = 2² × 3¹\nGiven LCM(P, Q, R) = 2⁵ × 3³ × 5² × 7¹\n\nWe know that for the HCF of numbers, we take the minimum power of each common prime factor. For the LCM, we take the maximum power of each prime factor present in any of the numbers.\n\n**1. For prime factor 2:**\nPowers in P, Q, R are a, 4, c.\nFrom HCF: min(a, 4, c) = 2. This implies a ge 2, c ge 2, and at least one of a or c must be 2.\nFrom LCM: max(a, 4, c) = 5. This implies at least one of a, 4, or c must be 5. Since 4 is not 5, either a=5 or c=5.\nTo minimize the sum a+b+c, we should choose the smallest possible values for a and c that satisfy these conditions. The pair (a, c) can be (2, 5) or (5, 2). In either case, a+c = 7.\nLet's choose a=2 and c=5 (or vice versa).\n\n**2. For prime factor 3:**\nPowers in P, Q, R are 3, b, 1.\nFrom HCF: min(3, b, 1) = 1. This implies b ge 1.\nFrom LCM: max(3, b, 1) = 3. This implies b le 3.\nSo, b can be 1, 2, or 3. To minimize a+b+c, we choose the minimum possible value for b, which is b=1.\n\n**3. For prime factor 5:**\nPowers in P, Q, R are 1, (not present in Q, so power is 0), 2.\nFrom HCF: min(1, 0, 2) = 0. (Consistent, as 5 is not a common factor in HCF 2² × 3¹)\nFrom LCM: max(1, 0, 2) = 2. (Consistent with 5² in LCM)\n\n**4. For prime factor 7:**\nPowers in P, Q, R are (not present in P, so power is 0), 1, (not present in R, so power is 0).\nFrom HCF: min(0, 1, 0) = 0. (Consistent, as 7 is not a common factor in HCF)\nFrom LCM: max(0, 1, 0) = 1. (Consistent with 7¹ in LCM)\n\nCombining the minimum values:\nWe found that minimum a+c = 7 (e.g., a=2, c=5).\nWe found that minimum b = 1.\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible sum of a+b+c = (a+c) + b = 7 + 1 = 8.",

          "explanation": "Let the time taken by the smaller pipe alone to fill the tank be x minutes.\nSince the larger pipe can fill the tank 10 minutes faster than the smaller pipe, the time taken by the larger pipe alone to fill the tank will be (x - 10) minutes.\n\nIn 1 minute, the smaller pipe fills 1/x of the tank.\nIn 1 minute, the larger pipe fills 1/(x - 10) of the tank.\n\nWhen both pipes are opened simultaneously, they fill the tank completely in 12 minutes.\nTherefore, in 1 minute, both pipes together fill 1/12 of the tank.\n\nAccording to the problem, the sum of their individual rates is equal to their combined rate:\n(1/x) + (1/x - 10) = (1/12)\n\nTo solve this equation, we find a common denominator for the terms on the left side:\n((x - 10) + x/x(x - 10)) = (1/12)\n(2x - 10/x² - 10x) = (1/12)\n\nNow, cross-multiply to eliminate the denominators:\n12(2x - 10) = 1(x² - 10x)\n24x - 120 = x² - 10x\n\nRearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic equation (ax² + bx + c = 0):\nx² - 10x - 24x + 120 = 0\nx² - 34x + 120 = 0\n\nNow, we solve the quadratic equation x² - 34x + 120 = 0. We can use factorization or the quadratic formula. Using factorization, we look for two numbers whose product is 120 and whose sum is -34. These numbers are -4 and -30.\nx² - 4x - 30x + 120 = 0\nx(x - 4) - 30(x - 4) = 0\n(x - 4)(x - 30) = 0\n\nThis gives two possible values for x:\nx - 4 = 0 Rightarrow x = 4\nx - 30 = 0 Rightarrow x = 30\n\nNow, we must interpret these solutions in the context of the problem.\n\nCase 1: If x = 4 minutes (time taken by the smaller pipe).\nThen, the time taken by the larger pipe = x - 10 = 4 - 10 = -6 minutes.\nTime cannot be negative, so this solution is not physically possible and must be discarded.\n\nCase 2: If x = 30 minutes (time taken by the smaller pipe).\nThen, the time taken by the larger pipe = x - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 minutes.\nBoth these times are positive, which makes this a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the smaller pipe alone takes 30 minutes to fill the tank, and the larger pipe alone takes 20 minutes to fill the tank.",

          "explanation": "(i) To find the maximum number of books she can put in each stack, we need to find the HCF (Highest Common Factor) of 360 and 480.\nPrime factorization of 360:\n360 = 2 × 180 = 2 × 2 × 90 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 45 = 2³ × 3 × 15 = 2³ × 3² × 5¹\nPrime factorization of 480:\n480 = 2 × 240 = 2 × 2 × 120 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 60 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 30 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 15 = 2⁵ × 3¹ × 5¹\n\nTo find the HCF, we take the product of the smallest powers of each common prime factor:\nHCF(360, 480) = 2^{text{min}(3,5)} × 3^{text{min}(2,1)} × 5^{text{min}(1,1)}\nHCF(360, 480) = 2³ × 3¹ × 5¹ = 8 × 3 × 5 = 120.\nSo, the maximum number of books she can put in each stack is 120.\n\n(ii) Number of stacks for Mathematics books = Total Mathematics books / Books per stack = 360 / 120 = 3\nNumber of stacks for Science books = Total Science books / Books per stack = 480 / 120 = 4\nTotal number of stacks = 3 + 4 = 7.\n\n(iii) From part (i):\nPrime factorization of 360: 2³ × 3² × 5¹. Here, a=3, b=2, c=1.\nPrime factorization of 480: 2⁵ × 3¹ × 5¹. Here, d=5, e=1, f=1.\n\nThe maximum number of books per stack (HCF) is 120, and its prime factorization is 120 = 2³ × 3¹ × 5¹.\n\nAnalyzing the relationship between the exponents:\nFor the prime factor 2: The exponent in the HCF (2³) is 3. This is the minimum of the exponents of 2 in 360 (a=3) and 480 (d=5). So, 3 = text{min}(3,5).\nFor the prime factor 3: The exponent in the HCF (3¹) is 1. This is the minimum of the exponents of 3 in 360 (b=2) and 480 (e=1). So, 1 = text{min}(2,1).\nFor the prime factor 5: The exponent in the HCF (5¹) is 1. This is the minimum of the exponents of 5 in 360 (c=1) and 480 (f=1). So, 1 = text{min}(1,1).\n\nTherefore, the relationship is that for each common prime factor, the exponent in the prime factorization of the HCF is the minimum of its exponents in the prime factorizations of the individual numbers.",

Prime factorization of 320 is 2⁶ × 5¹. Since the denominator is of the form 2ᵐ × 5ⁿ, this fraction has a terminating decimal expansion.\n2.  **Option B) (17/625)**: The denominator is 625. Prime factorization of 625 is 5⁴. Since the denominator is of the form 2ᵐ × 5ⁿ (here m=0), this fraction has a terminating decimal expansion.\n3.  **Option C) (23/200)**: The denominator is 200. Prime factorization of 200 is 2³ × 5². Since the denominator is of the form 2ᵐ × 5ⁿ, this fraction has a terminating decimal expansion.\n4.  **Option D) (11/150)**: The denominator is 150. Prime factorization of 150 is 2 × 3 × 5². Since the prime factorization of the denominator includes a prime factor (3) other than 2 or 5, this fraction has a non-terminating repeating decimal expansion.\n\nTherefore, (11/150) has a non-terminating repeating decimal expansion.",

The prime factorization of 6ⁿ is (2 × 3)^n = 2ⁿ × 3ⁿ. This factorization contains the prime factor 2 but not the prime factor 5. Therefore, according to the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, 6ⁿ cannot have 5 as a factor, and thus can never end with the digit 0. So, Assertion (A) is true.\n\nReason (R): This statement is a fundamental property derived from the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. If a number ends with 0, it is divisible by 10, meaning it has prime factors 2 and 5. Conversely, if a number's prime factorization includes both 2 and 5, it is divisible by 10, and therefore ends with 0. So, Reason (R) is true.\n\nSince the Reason (R) correctly explains why 6ⁿ cannot end with the digit 0 by stating the necessary condition for a number to end with 0, Reason (R) is the correct explanation for Assertion (A).",

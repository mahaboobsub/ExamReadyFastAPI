Substitute the value of k = 10:\n10/6 = 150/m\nSimplify 10/6 to 5/3:\n5/3 = 150/m\nCross-multiplying: 5m = 3 × 150\n5m = 450\nm = 450/5\nm = 90\n\nSo, for infinitely many production plans, the values are k = 10 and m = 90.\n\n**(d) If k=10, what could be a possible value of 'm' for no production plan (no solution)?**\nFor a pair of linear equations to have no solution, the condition is:\na₁/a₂ = b₁/b₂ ≠ c₁/c₂\n\nGiven that k = 10. Let's check the ratios using our equations:\na₁/a₂ = 5/3\nb₁/b₂ = k/6 = 10/6 = 5/3\nc₁/c₂ = 150/m\n\nFor no solution, we need a₁/a₂ = b₁/b₂ and b₁/b₂ ≠ c₁/c₂.\nThe first part (a₁/a₂ = b₁/b₂) is satisfied when k=10 (5/3 = 5/3).\nNow, we apply the second part of the condition: b₁/b₂ ≠ c₁/c₂\n5/3 ≠ 150/m\nCross-multiplying: 5 × m ≠ 3 × 150\n5m ≠ 450\nm ≠ 90\n\nSo, if k=10, any value of 'm' except 90 will result in no production plan (no solution). A possible value for 'm' could be 80 (or any other value not equal to 90, for instance, 70, 100, etc.).",

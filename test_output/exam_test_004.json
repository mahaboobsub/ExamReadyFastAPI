          "explanation": "<b>Analysis of Assertion (A):</b>\nThe given rational number is $\\frac{17}{8}$.\nTo find its decimal expansion, we can write the denominator in the form $2^m \\cdot 5^n$. The denominator $8$ can be written as $2^3$. \nTo make the denominator a power of $10$, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $5^3$:\n$\\frac{17}{8} = \\frac{17}{2^3} = \\frac{17 \\times 5^3}{2^3 \\times 5^3} = \\frac{17 \\times 125}{(2 \\times 5)^3} = \\frac{2125}{10^3} = \\frac{2125}{1000} = 2.125$.\nThe decimal expansion $2.125$ clearly terminates after three decimal places. Thus, Assertion (A) is true.\n\n<b>Analysis of Reason (R):</b>\nThe statement in Reason (R) is a fundamental theorem from the chapter Real Numbers, which states the condition for a rational number to have a terminating decimal expansion. This theorem is mathematically correct. Thus, Reason (R) is true.\n\n<b>Checking if R is the correct explanation of A:</b>\nAccording to Reason (R), a rational number has a terminating decimal expansion if the prime factorization of its denominator is of the form $2^m \\cdot 5^n$. In Assertion (A), the denominator is $8 = 2^3$, which is of the form $2^m \\cdot 5^n$ (with $m=3$ and $n=0$). This condition is met, explaining why the decimal expansion terminates. Furthermore, the number of decimal places after which the expansion terminates is determined by the highest power of either $2$ or $5$ in the denominator's prime factorization. In this case, the highest power is $3$ (from $2^3$), which means it terminates after $3$ decimal places. Therefore, Reason (R) correctly explains Assertion (A).\n\n<b>Conclusion:</b> Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true, and Reason (R) is the correct explanation of Assertion (A).",

          "explanation": "To determine the possible sets of values for (x, y, z) and (p, q, r), we use the fundamental properties of HCF (Highest Common Factor) and LCM (Least Common Multiple) in terms of prime factorization.\n\nFor any prime factor (say 'k'), if the exponents in the prime factorization of two numbers A and B are 'a_k' and 'b_k' respectively, then:\n1.  The exponent of 'k' in HCF(A, B) is min(a_k, b_k).\n2.  The exponent of 'k' in LCM(A, B) is max(a_k, b_k).\n\nApplying these rules to the given prime factors:\n\n**For prime factor 2:**\nGiven HCF(A, B) has 2^2, so min(x, p) = 2.\nGiven LCM(A, B) has 2^4, so max(x, p) = 4.\nThis implies that one of the exponents (x or p) must be 2 and the other must be 4. \nTherefore, the possible pairs for (x, p) are (2, 4) or (4, 2).\n\n**For prime factor 3:**\nGiven HCF(A, B) has 3^1, so min(y, q) = 1.\nGiven LCM(A, B) has 3^3, so max(y, q) = 3.\nThis implies that one of the exponents (y or q) must be 1 and the other must be 3. \nTherefore, the possible pairs for (y, q) are (1, 3) or (3, 1).\n\n**For prime factor 5:**\nGiven HCF(A, B) has 5^1, so min(z, r) = 1.\nGiven LCM(A, B) has 5^2, so max(z, r) = 2.\nThis implies that one of the exponents (z or r) must be 1 and the other must be 2. \nTherefore, the possible pairs for (z, r) are (1, 2) or (2, 1).\n\n**Possible Sets of Values:**\nThe values (x, y, z) and (p, q, r) are determined by combining these possibilities. For each prime factor, we have two choices for the assignment of exponents. \n\nFor example, one possible set of values could be:\nIf (x, p) = (2, 4),\nIf (y, q) = (1, 3),\nIf (z, r) = (1, 2).\nThen, (x, y, z) = (2, 1, 1) and (p, q, r) = (4, 3, 2).\n\nAnother possible set of values could be:\nIf (x, p) = (4, 2),\nIf (y, q) = (3, 1),\nIf (z, r) = (2, 1).\nThen, (x, y, z) = (4, 3, 2) and (p, q, r) = (2, 1, 1).\n\nIn general, for each prime factor, the exponent for A and B must be the minimum and maximum value as derived from the HCF and LCM, in some order. There are 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 such unique combinations for the sets [(x,y,z), (p,q,r)].\n\n**Justification:**\nThe relationship HCF(A, B) * LCM(A, B) = A * B holds true. Let's verify this using the exponents:\nFor prime 2: min(x,p) + max(x,p) = 2 + 4 = 6. Also, x + p = 6. This confirms the property for exponents.\nSimilarly for prime 3: min(y,q) + max(y,q) = 1 + 3 = 4. Also, y + q = 4.\nAnd for prime 5: min(z,r) + max(z,r) = 1 + 2 = 3. Also, z + r = 3.\n\nThis confirms that for each prime factor, the sum of the exponents in A and B must be equal to the sum of the exponents in their HCF and LCM. This fundamental relationship allows us to deduce the possible pairs of exponents for each prime factor in A and B.",

No other prime factors should be present in the denominator. This is a direct consequence of the theorem on decimal expansions of rational numbers.\n\n**(iv) Mr. Gupta's claim about the total number of sweets divided by the maximum number of sweets per box:**\nTotal number of sweets = $324 + 252 + 180 = 756$\nMaximum number of sweets per box = 36 (from part i)\n\nThe division result = $756 / 36 = 21$\n\n21 is an integer. All integers are rational numbers because they can be expressed in the form $p/q$, where $q \\neq 0$ (e.g., $21 = 21/1$).\nTherefore, **Mr. Gupta's claim is correct**.

          "explanation": "**(a) Formulation of Linear Equations:**\nLet the fixed charge for the first three days be ₹x.\nLet the additional charge for each day thereafter be ₹y.\n\nFor Preeti, who kept the book for 7 days:\nNumber of days for additional charge = 7 - 3 = 4 days.\nTotal charge = Fixed charge + (Additional days × Additional charge per day)\n₹27 = x + 4y.\nSo, the first equation is $x + 4y = 27$.\n\nFor Richa, who kept the book for 5 days:\nNumber of days for additional charge = 5 - 3 = 2 days.\nTotal charge = Fixed charge + (Additional days × Additional charge per day)\n₹21 = x + 2y.\nSo, the second equation is $x + 2y = 21$.\n\nThe pair of linear equations representing the situation is:\n1) $x + 4y = 27$\n2) $x + 2y = 21$\n\n**(b) Determination of Fixed and Additional Charges:**\nWe have the system of equations:\n1) $x + 4y = 27$\n2) $x + 2y = 21$\n\nSubtract Equation (2) from Equation (1):\n$(x + 4y) - (x + 2y) = 27 - 21$\n$x + 4y - x - 2y = 6$\n$2y = 6$\n$y = 3$\n\nSubstitute the value of y = 3 into Equation (2):\n$x + 2(3) = 21$\n$x + 6 = 21$\n$x = 21 - 6$\n$x = 15$\n\nSo, the fixed charge is ₹15 and the additional charge per day is ₹3.\n\n**(c) Analysis of a New Scheme:**\nNew scheme: Fixed charge = ₹18, Additional charge per day = ₹2.\n\nLet's calculate the payments for Preeti and Richa under this new scheme:\nFor Preeti (7 days): Payment = Fixed charge + (7-3) × Additional charge per day\nPayment = $18 + 4 \times 2 = 18 + 8 = ₹26$.\nOriginal payment for Preeti was ₹27. Since ₹26 $\neq$ ₹27, the new scheme does not result in the same payment for Preeti.\n\nFor Richa (5 days): Payment = Fixed charge + (5-3) × Additional charge per day\nPayment = $18 + 2 \times 2 = 18 + 4 = ₹22$.\nOriginal payment for Richa was ₹21. Since ₹22 $\neq$ ₹21, the new scheme does not result in the same payment for Richa.\n\nConclusion: No, this new scheme would not result in the same total payments for Preeti and Richa as in the original problem.\nJustification: The calculated payments under the new scheme (₹26 for Preeti and ₹22 for Richa) do not match their original payments (₹27 for Preeti and ₹21 for Richa).\n\n**(d) Consistency of a New System and Graphical Implication:**\nThe new policy leads to the equations:\n1) $F + 4A = 27$\n2) $F + 4A = 21$\n\nTo check the consistency of this system, we can subtract Equation (2) from Equation (1):\n$(F + 4A) - (F + 4A) = 27 - 21$\n$0 = 6$\n\nThis is a false statement, as 0 cannot be equal to 6.\nConclusion: Since we obtain a false statement involving no variables, the system of equations is **inconsistent**.\nGraphically: An inconsistent system of linear equations implies that the lines representing the two equations are **parallel** and do not intersect at any point. Therefore, there is no common solution that satisfies both equations simultaneously.",

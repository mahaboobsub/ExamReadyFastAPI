          "explanation": "Let 'M' be the positive integer.\n\n**Part 1: Finding the smallest number 'M'**\n1.  **Understand the remainder condition**: When M is divided by 12, 15, and 20, it leaves a remainder of 7. This means that (M - 7) must be a multiple of 12, 15, and 20. Therefore, (M - 7) is a common multiple of 12, 15, and 20.\n2.  **Find the LCM**: To find the smallest such M, we first find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 12, 15, and 20.\n    *   Prime factorization of 12 = $2^2 \\times 3$\n    *   Prime factorization of 15 = $3 \\times 5$\n    *   Prime factorization of 20 = $2^2 \\times 5$\n    *   LCM(12, 15, 20) = $2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 4 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 60$.\n3.  **Formulate M**: So, (M - 7) must be a multiple of 60. This can be written as M - 7 = 60k, where k is a positive integer. Therefore, M = 60k + 7.\n4.  **Apply the multiple of 11 condition**: We are given that M is a multiple of 11. So, M = 11n for some integer n.\n    *   We need to find the smallest 'k' such that 60k + 7 is a multiple of 11.\n    *   Let's test values for k:\n        *   If k = 1, M = 60(1) + 7 = 67 (Not a multiple of 11, $67 = 6 \\times 11 + 1$)\n        *   If k = 2, M = 60(2) + 7 = 120 + 7 = 127 (Not a multiple of 11, $127 = 11 \\times 11 + 6$)\n        *   If k = 3, M = 60(3) + 7 = 180 + 7 = 187 (A multiple of 11, $187 = 11 \\times 17$)\n    *   The smallest value of k is 3, which gives the smallest M.\n    *   Thus, the smallest number M = 187.\n\n**Part 2: Analyze why M must be greater than 100**\n1.  **General form of M**: From the first part, we established that any number M satisfying the remainder conditions must be of the form M = 60k + 7, where k is a non-negative integer.\n2.  **Condition for M to be a multiple of 11**: We also know M must be a multiple of 11. So, $60k + 7$ must be divisible by 11.\n3.  **Modular arithmetic analysis**: We can write this as a congruence relation:\n    $60k + 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$\n    Since $60 = 5 \\times 11 + 5$, we have $60 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$.\n    So, the congruence becomes:\n    $5k + 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$\n    Subtract 7 from both sides:\n    $5k \\equiv -7 \\pmod{11}$\n    Since $-7 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}$, we have:\n    $5k \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}$\n    To solve for k, we can multiply by the modular inverse of 5 modulo 11. The inverse is 9, because $5 \\times 9 = 45$, and $45 = 4 \\times 11 + 1$, so $5 \\times 9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$.\n    $9 \\times (5k) \\equiv 9 \\times 4 \\pmod{11}$\n    $45k \\equiv 36 \\pmod{11}$\n    $k \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$ (Since $45 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ and $36 = 3 \\times 11 + 3$, so $36 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$)\n4.  **Smallest value of k**: This congruence tells us that k must be of the form $11j + 3$ for some integer j. Since k must be a positive integer (because M is a positive integer greater than 7, so 60k must be positive), the smallest positive integer value for j is 0, which gives k = 3.\n5.  **Conclusion**: Substituting the smallest possible value of k (which is 3) back into the equation M = 60k + 7, we get:\n    M = 60(3) + 7 = 180 + 7 = 187.\n    Since the smallest possible integer M satisfying all the given conditions is 187, and 187 is clearly greater than 100, any positive integer M that fulfills these conditions must necessarily be greater than 100. There are no possible values of M less than or equal to 100 that satisfy all the given criteria.",

          "explanation": "**Part A: Proof that $\\sqrt{7}$ is an irrational number.**\n1.  Assume, to the contrary, that $\\sqrt{7}$ is a rational number.\n2.  Therefore, we can find co-prime integers 'a' and 'b' (where b ≠ 0) such that $\\sqrt{7} = \\frac{a}{b}$.\n3.  Squaring both sides, we get $7 = \\frac{a^2}{b^2}$.\n4.  This implies $a^2 = 7b^2$. (Equation 1)\n5.  From Equation 1, we can infer that $a^2$ is divisible by 7. By the theorem that states if a prime number 'p' divides $a^2$, then 'p' divides 'a', we can conclude that 'a' is divisible by 7.\n6.  Since 'a' is divisible by 7, we can write $a = 7c$ for some integer 'c'.\n7.  Substituting this value of 'a' into Equation 1: $(7c)^2 = 7b^2$.\n8.  $49c^2 = 7b^2$.\n9.  Dividing by 7, we get $7c^2 = b^2$.\n10. From this, we can infer that $b^2$ is divisible by 7. Again, by the same theorem, 'b' is divisible by 7.\n11. Since 'a' and 'b' are both divisible by 7, they have a common factor of 7. This contradicts our initial assumption that 'a' and 'b' are co-prime.\n12. Therefore, our assumption that $\\sqrt{7}$ is rational is false. Hence, $\\sqrt{7}$ is an irrational number.\n\n**Part B: Proof that $5 + 2\\sqrt{7}$ is an irrational number.**\n1.  Assume, to the contrary, that $5 + 2\\sqrt{7}$ is a rational number.\n2.  Therefore, we can find co-prime integers 'p' and 'q' (where q ≠ 0) such that $5 + 2\\sqrt{7} = \\frac{p}{q}$.\n3.  Rearranging the equation to isolate $\\sqrt{7}$: $2\\sqrt{7} = \\frac{p}{q} - 5$.\n4.  $2\\sqrt{7} = \\frac{p - 5q}{q}$.\n5.  $\\sqrt{7} = \\frac{p - 5q}{2q}$.\n6.  Since 'p', 'q', 5, and 2 are integers, and q ≠ 0, then $\\frac{p - 5q}{2q}$ is a rational number.\n7.  This implies that $\\sqrt{7}$ is a rational number.\n8.  However, this contradicts the fact that $\\sqrt{7}$ is an irrational number (proven in Part A).\n9.  Therefore, our assumption that $5 + 2\\sqrt{7}$ is rational is false. Hence, $5 + 2\\sqrt{7}$ is an irrational number.\n\n**Part C:**\n(i) **Time to meet again at the starting point:**\nTo find when they will all meet again at the starting point for the first time, we need to find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the time taken by each friend to complete one round (12 minutes, 15 minutes, and 20 minutes).\n1.

So, $P(1) = -18$.\nSubstitute $x = 1$ into the polynomial:\n$-18 = A(1 + 2)(1 - 5)$\n$-18 = A(3)(-4)$\n$-18 = -12A$\n$A = \\frac{-18}{-12} = \\frac{3}{2}$\nSo, the polynomial is $P(x) = \\frac{3}{2}(x + 2)(x - 5)$.\nExpanding this:\n$P(x) = \\frac{3}{2}(x^2 - 5x + 2x - 10)$\n$P(x) = \\frac{3}{2}(x^2 - 3x - 10)$\n$P(x) = \\frac{3}{2}x^2 - \\frac{9}{2}x - 15$\n\n**(ii) Find the value of k:**\nGiven quadratic polynomial $Q(x) = kx^2 - 8x - 10$.\nComparing with the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c$, we have $a = k$, $b = -8$, $c = -10$.\nSum of zeroes ($\\alpha + \\beta$) = $-\\frac{b}{a}$. We are given sum of zeroes = 4.\nSo, $4 = -\\frac{(-8)}{k} = \\frac{8}{k}$\n$4k = 8$\n$k = \\frac{8}{4} = 2$\n\nProduct of zeroes ($\\alpha\\beta$) = $\\frac{c}{a}$. We are given product of zeroes = -5.\nSo, $-5 = \\frac{-10}{k}$\n$-5k = -10$\n$k = \\frac{-10}{-5} = 2$\nBoth conditions consistently give $k = 2$.\n\n**(iii) Find the other two zeroes of R(x):**\nGiven cubic polynomial $R(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 - 7x + 10$.\nOne zero is given as 1. This means $(x - 1)$ is a factor of $R(x)$ by the Factor Theorem.\nWe can use polynomial division to find the other factors.\n\n\n        x^2 - 3x - 10\n      ________________\nx - 1 | x^3 - 4x^2 - 7x + 10\n        -(x^3 - x^2)\n        ____________\n              -3x^2 - 7x\n            -(-3x^2 + 3x)\n            ____________\n                    -10x + 10\n                  -(-10x + 10)\n                  ____________\n                          0\n\nSo, $R(x) = (x - 1)(x^2 - 3x - 10)$.\nNow, we need to find the zeroes of the quadratic factor $x^2 - 3x - 10$.\nFactor the quadratic by splitting the middle term: We look for two numbers that multiply to -10 and add to -3. These numbers are -5 and 2.\nSo, $x^2 - 3x - 10 = x^2 - 5x + 2x - 10 = x(x - 5) + 2(x - 5) = (x - 5)(x + 2)$.\nSetting the factors to zero to find the zeroes:\n$x - 5 = 0 \\implies x = 5$\n$x + 2 = 0 \\implies x = -2$\n\nTherefore, the other two zeroes of the polynomial $R(x)$ are 5 and -2.",

          "explanation": "**(a) If k = 240:**\nThe given pair of linear equations is:\n1.  $2x + 3y = 120$\n2.  $4x + 6y = 240$\n\nComparing these with the standard form $a_1x + b_1y + c_1 = 0$ and $a_2x + b_2y + c_2 = 0$:\n$a_1 = 2, b_1 = 3, c_1 = -120$\n$a_2 = 4, b_2 = 6, c_2 = -240$\n\nCalculate the ratios of coefficients:\n$\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$\n$\frac{b_1}{b_2} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$\n$\frac{c_1}{c_2} = \frac{-120}{-240} = \frac{1}{2}$\n\nSince $\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{b_1}{b_2} = \frac{c_1}{c_2}$, the lines representing the equations are coincident. This means the system has infinitely many solutions. Therefore, the production plan allows for infinitely many combinations of Classic and Modern lamps that satisfy both constraints.\n\n**(b) If k = 200:**\nThe given pair of linear equations is:\n1.  $2x + 3y = 120$\n2.  $4x + 6y = 200$\n\nComparing these with the standard form:\n$a_1 = 2, b_1 = 3, c_1 = -120$\n$a_2 = 4, b_2 = 6, c_2 = -200$\n\nCalculate the ratios of coefficients:\n$\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$\n$\frac{b_1}{b_2} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$\n$\frac{c_1}{c_2} = \frac{-120}{-200} = \frac{120}{200} = \frac{3}{5}$\n\nSince $\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{b_1}{b_2} \neq \frac{c_1}{c_2}$, the lines representing the equations are parallel. This means the system has no solution. Therefore, the production plan is infeasible; there is no combination of Classic and Modern lamps that can be produced daily to satisfy both the brass and labor constraints simultaneously.\n\n**(c) Condition for unique solution and analysis for p=4, k=210:**\nThe modified equations are:\n1.  $2x + 3y = 120$\n2.  $px + 6y = k$\n\nFor a unique solution, the lines representing the equations must intersect at a single point. This condition is given by $\frac{a_1}{a_2} \neq \frac{b_1}{b_2}$.\n\nFrom the equations:\n$a_1 = 2, b_1 = 3$\n$a_2 = p, b_2 = 6$\n\nApplying the condition for a unique solution:\n$\frac{2}{p} \neq \frac{3}{6}$\n$\frac{2}{p} \neq \frac{1}{2}$\n$2 \times 2 \neq 1 \times p$\n$4 \neq p$\n\nSo, to guarantee a unique solution, the labor required for a Classic lamp, $p$, must not be equal to 4 hours.\n\nNow, consider the case if $k = 210$ hours and $p = 4$ hours:\nThe equations become:\n1.  $2x + 3y = 120$\n2.  $4x + 6y = 210$\n\nCalculate the ratios of coefficients:\n$\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$\n$\frac{b_1}{b_2} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$\n$\frac{c_1}{c_2} = \frac{-120}{-210} = \frac{120}{210} = \frac{4}{7}$\n\nSince $\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{b_1}{b_2} \neq \frac{c_1}{c_2}$, this system has no solution (parallel lines). Therefore, if $k = 210$ hours, $p$ *cannot* be 4 hours if the goal is to achieve a unique solution. Setting $p=4$ hours would lead to an inconsistent system with no feasible production plan, not a unique one.",

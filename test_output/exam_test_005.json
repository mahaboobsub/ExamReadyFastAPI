(x, y) = (1, 12): HCF(1, 12) = 1. This pair is valid.\n2. (x, y) = (2, 6): HCF(2, 6) = 2 \\ne 1. This pair is not valid.\n3. (x, y) = (3, 4): HCF(3, 4) = 1. This pair is valid.\n\nStep 5: Determine the possible values for 'a' and 'b'.\nUsing the valid (x, y) pairs:\nCase 1: If (x, y) = (1, 12)\na = 30 \\times 1 = 30\nb = 30 \\times 12 = 360\nSo, one possible pair for (a, b) is (30, 360).\n\nCase 2: If (x, y) = (3, 4)\na = 30 \\times 3 = 90\nb = 30 \\times 4 = 120\nSo, another possible pair for (a, b) is (90, 120).\n\nThus, the possible pairs for (a, b) are (30, 360), (360, 30), (90, 120), and (120, 90).\n\nStep 6: Determine the number of distinct pairs (a, b) such that 'a' < 'b'.\nFrom the possible pairs found in Step 5, the distinct pairs where 'a' is less than 'b' are:\n1. (30, 360)\n2. (90, 120)\nThere are 2 such distinct pairs that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nStep 7: Critically analyze if there can be a pair (a, b) such that 'a' is a perfect square and 'b' is a perfect cube.\nTo analyze this, we use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (prime factorization) for HCF and LCM:\nHCF(a, b) = 30 = 2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1\nLCM(a, b) = 360 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1\n\nLet the prime factorization of 'a' be $2^{e_1} \\times 3^{e_2} \\times 5^{e_3}$ and 'b' be $2^{f_1} \\times 3^{f_2} \\times 5^{f_3}$.\nAccording to the properties of HCF and LCM:\nFor each prime factor p (say 2, 3, or 5), the exponent in HCF is $\\min(e_i, f_i)$, and the exponent in LCM is $\\max(e_i, f_i)$.\n\nConsider the prime factor 2:\n$\\min(e_1, f_1) = 1$ (from HCF exponent of 2)\n$\\max(e_1, f_1) = 3$ (from LCM exponent of 2)\nThis implies that the exponents for the prime factor 2 in 'a' and 'b' must be (1, 3) or (3, 1). In other words, one number must have $2^1$ and the other must have $2^3$ in its prime factorization.\n\nFor 'a' to be a perfect square, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be even. This means $e_1, e_2, e_3$ must all be even integers.\nHowever, from our analysis for the prime factor 2, $e_1$ must be either 1 or 3. Both 1 and 3 are odd numbers.\nTherefore, 'a' cannot have an even exponent for the prime factor 2, which is a necessary condition for 'a' to be a perfect square.\n\nConclusion:\nIt is not possible for 'a' to be a perfect square under these conditions. Since the condition requires 'a' to be a perfect square AND 'b' to be a perfect cube, if 'a' cannot be a perfect square, the entire condition cannot be satisfied.\n\nJustification:\nThe exponents of the prime factor 2 in the prime factorization of 'a' and 'b' must be 1 and 3 (in some order). For 'a' to be a perfect square, the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization ($e_1$) must be an even number. However, the possible values for $e_1$ (1 or 3) are both odd. Hence, 'a' cannot be a perfect square given the HCF and LCM, making it impossible for the combined condition ('a' is a perfect square and 'b' is a perfect cube) to be true.",

          "explanation": "(a) For the quadratic polynomial $p(x) = x^2 - (k+6)x + 2(2k-1)$, let its zeroes be $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\nFrom the relations between zeroes and coefficients:\nSum of zeroes, $\\alpha + \\beta = -\\frac{\\text{coefficient of } x}{\\text{coefficient of } x^2} = -\\frac{-(k+6)}{1} = k+6$.\nProduct of zeroes, $\\alpha \\beta = \\frac{\\text{constant term}}{\\text{coefficient of } x^2} = \\frac{2(2k-1)}{1} = 4k-2$.\n\nGiven condition: The sum of the zeroes is half of their product.\n$\\alpha + \\beta = \\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha \\beta)$\n$k+6 = \\frac{1}{2}(4k-2)$\n$k+6 = 2k-1$\n$6+1 = 2k-k$\n$k=7$\n\n(b) Substitute $k=7$ into the polynomial $p(x)$:\n$p(x) = x^2 - (7+6)x + 2(2(7)-1)$\n$p(x) = x^2 - 13x + 2(14-1)$\n$p(x) = x^2 - 13x + 2(13)$\n$p(x) = x^2 - 13x + 26$\n\nTo find the zeroes of $p(x)$, we set $p(x)=0$ and use the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\nHere, $a=1$, $b=-13$, $c=26$.\n$x = \\frac{-(-13) \\pm \\sqrt{(-13)^2 - 4(1)(26)}}{2(1)}$\n$x = \\frac{13 \\pm \\sqrt{169 - 104}}{2}$\n$x = \\frac{13 \\pm \\sqrt{65}}{2}$\nSo, the zeroes of $p(x)$ are $\\alpha = \\frac{13 + \\sqrt{65}}{2}$ and $\\beta = \\frac{13 - \\sqrt{65}}{2}$.\n\n(c) For the new polynomial $q(x)$, its zeroes are $\\alpha' = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}$ and $\\beta' = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}$.\nWe need to find the sum and product of these new zeroes.\n\nSum of new zeroes: $\\alpha' + \\beta' = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\alpha^2 + \\beta^2}{\\alpha \\beta}$\nWe know that $\\alpha^2 + \\beta^2 = (\\alpha+\\beta)^2 - 2\\alpha\\beta$.\nFrom part (a) and (b), for $k=7$, we have $\\alpha+\\beta = 13$ and $\\alpha\\beta = 26$.\nSo, $\\alpha^2 + \\beta^2 = (13)^2 - 2(26) = 169 - 52 = 117$.\nTherefore, $\\alpha' + \\beta' = \\frac{117}{26}$.\n\nProduct of new zeroes: $\\alpha' \\beta' = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}\\right) = 1$.\n\nA quadratic polynomial with zeroes $\\alpha'$ and $\\beta'$ can be written in the form $C[x^2 - (\\alpha'+\\beta')x + \\alpha'\\beta']$, where $C$ is any non-zero constant.\nSubstituting the sum and product of the new zeroes:\n$q(x) = C\\left[x^2 - \\left(\\frac{117}{26}\\right)x + 1\\right]$\n\nTo evaluate whether $q(x)$ can be a polynomial with integer coefficients, we need to check if we can choose a value for $C$ such that all coefficients become integers.\nIf we choose $C=26$ (the LCM of the denominators of the coefficients), then:\n$q(x) = 26\\left[x^2 - \\frac{117}{26}x + 1\\right]$\n$q(x) = 26x^2 - 117x + 26$\n\nSince 26, -117, and 26 are all integers, $q(x)$ can indeed be a polynomial with integer coefficients.\n\nJustification: A quadratic polynomial with rational coefficients can always be scaled by multiplying by the least common multiple of the denominators of its coefficients to obtain a polynomial with integer coefficients. In this case, the sum of zeroes is $\\frac{117}{26}$ (a rational number) and the product of zeroes is $1$ (an integer). By choosing the constant $C=26$, which is the denominator of the sum of zeroes, all coefficients become integers.",

          "explanation": "Part (i): Finding the number of flower pots produced.\nLet 'x' be the number of ceramic flower pots produced on that day.\nAccording to the problem, the cost of production of each flower pot is ₹(50 - x).\nThe total cost of production on that day is given as ₹600.\nTherefore, (Number of pots) × (Cost per pot) = Total cost\nx * (50 - x) = 600\n50x - x^2 = 600\nRearranging the terms to form a standard quadratic equation:\nx^2 - 50x + 600 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can use factorization (splitting the middle term):\nWe need two numbers whose product is 600 and sum is -50. These numbers are -20 and -30.\nx^2 - 20x - 30x + 600 = 0\nx(x - 20) - 30(x - 20) = 0\n(x - 20)(x - 30) = 0\nSo, x - 20 = 0  or  x - 30 = 0\nx = 20  or  x = 30\nThus, the number of flower pots produced could be 20 or 30.\n\nPart (ii): Analyzing the condition for cost per flower pot.\nWe have two possible values for the number of flower pots produced: x = 20 and x = 30.\n\nCase 1: If x = 20 flower pots are produced.\nCost of production of each flower pot = ₹(50 - x) = ₹(50 - 20) = ₹30.\n\nCase 2: If x = 30 flower pots are produced.\nCost of production of each flower pot = ₹(50 - x) = ₹(50 - 30) = ₹20.\n\nThe industry owner decides that the cost of production for each flower pot must not exceed ₹25.\n\nFrom Case 1, if 20 flower pots are produced, the cost per pot is ₹30, which is greater than ₹25. So, this option is not acceptable as per the owner's decision.\n\nFrom Case 2, if 30 flower pots are produced, the cost per pot is ₹20, which is less than or equal to ₹25. So, this option is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, to achieve a total cost of ₹600 while ensuring the cost of production for each flower pot does not exceed ₹25, the industry must produce 30 flower pots. This is the minimum number of pots among the valid options that meets the specific criteria.\n\nJustification: Producing 30 flower pots results in a cost of ₹20 per pot, which satisfies the condition of not exceeding ₹25 per pot. Producing 20 flower pots results in a cost of ₹30 per pot, which violates the condition of not exceeding ₹25 per pot.",

Subtract Equation (2) from Equation (1):\n\\( (x + 4y) - (x + 2y) = 27 - 21 \\)\n\\( x + 4y - x - 2y = 6 \\)\n\\( 2y = 6 \\)\n\\( y = \\frac{6}{2} \\)\n\\( y = 3 \\)\n\nNow, substitute the value of \\( y = 3 \\) into Equation (2):\n\\( x + 2(3) = 21 \\)\n\\( x + 6 = 21 \\)\n\\( x = 21 - 6 \\)\n\\( x = 15 \\)\n\nTherefore, the fixed charge is \\( \\u20b9 15 \\) and the additional charge per day is \\( \\u20b9 3 \\).\n\n**(iii) Calculate the amount Priya would pay if she keeps a book for nine days:**\nPriya keeps the book for 9 days. This includes 3 days with a fixed charge and \\( 9 - 3 = 6 \\) additional days.\nTotal charge for Priya = Fixed charge + (Number of additional days \\( \\times \\) Additional charge per day)\nTotal charge = \\( x + 6y \\)\nSubstitute the values \\( x = 15 \\) and \\( y = 3 \\):\nTotal charge = \\( 15 + 6(3) \\)\nTotal charge = \\( 15 + 18 \\)\nTotal charge = \\( 33 \\)\n\nSo, Priya would pay \\( \\u20b9 33 \\) for keeping the book for nine days.",

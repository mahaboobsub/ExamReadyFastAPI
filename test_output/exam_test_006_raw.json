(This is a known fact, or can be proven separately if required).\nThis creates a contradiction: a number cannot be both rational and irrational simultaneously.\n\nStep 5: Conclude.\nThe contradiction arose because our initial assumption that $3 + 2\\sqrt{5}$ is rational was false.\nTherefore, $3 + 2\\sqrt{5}$ must be an irrational number.",

We know that $\\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number. According to the statement, $\\sqrt{2+1} = \\sqrt{3}$ should also be irrational. Indeed, $\\sqrt{3}$ is an irrational number. This case supports the statement, but one supporting case does not prove it true for all $n$.\n\n*   Let's consider $n=3$. We know that $\\sqrt{3}$ is an irrational number. According to the statement, $\\sqrt{3+1}$ should also be irrational. Let's calculate $\\sqrt{3+1}$.\n    $\\sqrt{3+1} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the counterexample.**\nIn the case of $n=3$, we found that $\\sqrt{n} = \\sqrt{3}$ is irrational, but $\\sqrt{n+1} = 2$ is a rational number. This contradicts the teacher's statement.\n\n**Step 4: Justify why this is a valid counterexample using definitions.**\n*   **Definition of an irrational number:** A number that cannot be expressed in the form $p/q$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \\neq 0$.\n*   **Definition of a rational number:** A number that can be expressed in the form $p/q$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \\neq 0$.\n\nWe accept that $\\sqrt{3}$ cannot be expressed as a fraction $p/q$ for integers $p,q$ ($q \\neq 0$), hence $\\sqrt{3}$ is an irrational number.\n\nHowever, $\\sqrt{3+1} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$. The number $2$ can be expressed as $2/1$, where $2$ and $1$ are integers and $1 \\neq 0$. Therefore, $2$ is a rational number.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion.**\nSince we found a positive integer $n=3$ for which $\\sqrt{n}$ (i.e., $\\sqrt{3}$) is irrational, but $\\sqrt{n+1}$ (i.e., $\\sqrt{4}=2$) is rational, the teacher's statement is false.

          "correctAnswer": "See explanation for detailed answers to all sub-parts.",
          "explanation": "(i) Zeros of the polynomial:\nSince the base of the arch is 6 meters wide and its center is at the origin (0,0), the arch meets the ground at x-coordinates that are 3 meters to the left and 3 meters to the right of the center. Therefore, the points where the arch meets the ground are (-3, 0) and (3, 0). These x-coordinates are the zeros of the polynomial.\nSo, the zeros are -3 and 3.\n\n(ii) Equation of the quadratic polynomial:\nIf the zeros of the polynomial are `\\alpha` and `\\beta`, the polynomial can be written in the form `p(x) = k(x - \\alpha)(x - \\beta)`.\nHere, `\\alpha = -3` and `\\beta = 3`.\nSo, `p(x) = k(x - (-3))(x - 3) = k(x + 3)(x - 3) = k(x^2 - 9)`.\nThe vertex of the arch is at (0, 4.5). This means `p(0) = 4.5`.\nSubstitute x = 0 into the equation: `p(0) = k(0^2 - 9) = k(-9)`.\nWe have `k(-9) = 4.5`.\n`k = \\frac{4.5}{-9} = -\\frac{1}{2}` or `-0.5`.\nTherefore, the equation of the quadratic polynomial is `p(x) = -0.5(x^2 - 9)` which simplifies to `p(x) = -0.5x^2 + 4.5`.\n\n(iii) Length of the horizontal support beam:\nThe support beam is at a height of 3 meters. So, we need to find the x-values for which `p(x) = 3`.\n`-0.5x^2 + 4.5 = 3`\n`-0.5x^2 = 3 - 4.5`\n`-0.5x^2 = -1.5`\n`x^2 = \\frac{-1.5}{-0.5}`\n`x^2 = 3`\n`x = \\pm \\sqrt{3}`\nThe x-coordinates where the beam meets the arch are `-\\sqrt{3}` and `\\sqrt{3}`.\nThe length of the support beam is the distance between these two points: `\\sqrt{3} - (-\\sqrt{3}) = 2\\sqrt{3}` meters.\n\n(iv) Comparison of arch flatness/steepness:\nOriginal design polynomial: `p(x) = -0.5x^2 + 4.5`. The leading coefficient is `a_1 = -0.5`.\nNew design: Arch is 8 meters wide and 4.5 meters high at its center (vertex at (0, 4.5)).\nThis means the zeros are at `\\pm 4`.\nThe polynomial for the new design would be `p_2(x) = k(x - 4)(x + 4) = k(x^2 - 16)`.\nSince `p_2(0) = 4.5`, we have `k(0^2 - 16) = 4.5`.\n`k(-16) = 4.5`\n`k = \\frac{4.5}{-16} = -\\frac{9}{32}`.\nSo, the new polynomial is `p_2(x) = -\\frac{9}{32}x^2 + 4.5`. The leading coefficient is `a_2 = -\\frac{9}{32} \\approx -0.28125`.\nThe absolute value of the leading coefficient `|a|` determines the width of the parabola. A smaller `|a|` means a wider (flatter) parabola, and a larger `|a|` means a narrower (steeper) parabola.\nComparing `|a_1| = |-0.5| = 0.5` and `|a_2| = |-\\frac{9}{32}| \\approx 0.28125`.\nSince `0.28125 < 0.5`, the absolute value of the leading coefficient for the new design is smaller.\nTherefore, the new arch would appear **flatter** than the original design.",
